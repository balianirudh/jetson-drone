# Jetson Drone

I have built two drones with the help of the Cooperative Distributions Systems Lab at the University of Cincinnati. I started working there in the fall of 2018 and have focused on learning different control systems applicable to drones. The first drone I worked on was very rudimentary. It used an Arduino Uno as the main processor and an IMU sensor to monitor the orientation of the drone.

Upon diving deeper into computer vision and more complex control systems, I decided to make a second drone, the Jetson Drone, that is better suited for high-level autonomy. The major improvement compared to the first drone is the integration of the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and the use of a camera to give the drone hardware that is better suited for autonomy.
